        <!-- Sometimes, not everything that you can see is everything that exists.
        Hope this teaches you a lesson, a basic one on how sometimes people might want to hide things in plain sight

        Anyways, here you go: 
        Being a budding new developer who lost your phone, you decide to write "Help, my phone is taken and I want it back!!" in 4 different 
        languages in order to impress the beings who confiscated your phone, that you are willing to learn. You may make use of tools such as 
        https://codecollab.io in order to share your code with us and to compile them for compiled languages.

        Submit your links (4 of them) here: http://go.dhs.sg/iccbd6-19
        -->
        <h2>Come closer...take a closer look... because the closer you get, the less you see</h2>
